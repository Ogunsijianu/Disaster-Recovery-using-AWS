# AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (DRS) Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide outlines the steps to set up and use AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (DRS) for your on-premises or cloud-based servers.

## Prerequisites
- AWS account with necessary permissions
- Source servers meet AWS DRS requirements
- Network connectivity between source servers and AWS

## Steps

### 1. Set up AWS Environment
1. Log in to AWS Console
2. Navigate to Elastic Disaster Recovery service
3. Select your target AWS Region

### 2. Install and Configure AWS Replication Agent
1. Download AWS Replication Agent
2. Install agent on each source server
3. Configure agent with AWS credentials and region

### 3. Define Replication Settings
1. In AWS DRS console, configure replication settings
2. Select volumes to replicate
3. Set replication server instance type
4. Configure network settings

### 4. Initiate and Monitor Replication
1. Start replication process
2. Monitor initial sync progress in AWS DRS console
3. Verify continuous data replication

### 5. Set Up Launch and Recovery Settings
1. Configure launch settings for recovery instances
2. Set up Recovery Plans for automated recovery
3. Define recovery instance types, networks, and security groups

### 6. Test Failover
1. Perform a non-disruptive test failover
2. Verify application functionality in AWS
3. Terminate test instances after validation

### 7. Implement Failover Process
1. Document failover procedure
2. Assign roles and responsibilities
3. Conduct regular drills

### 8. Failback (When Ready)
1. Reverse replication to original source
2. Verify data integrity
3. Switch back to original environment

## Maintenance
- Regularly update AWS Replication Agent
- Monitor replication health and resolve any issues promptly
- Periodically review and update recovery settings

## Troubleshooting
- Check AWS DRS documentation for common issues
- Review CloudWatch logs for detailed error messages
- Contact AWS Support for unresolved issues

## Features of Disaster Recovery
a. Resize: By abstracting cluster management, resizing the cluster becomes straightforward as the underlying auto-scaling group can simply be scaled as desired.

b. Snapshots: Periodically are done everyday and are deleted every 7 days, snapshots of the entire key-value space are captured, from each of the source server and uploaded to an encrypted external storage, allowing the etcd (or human) operator to restore the store at a later time, in any  instance.

c. Failure recovery: Upon failure of a minority of the etcd members, the managed members automatically restarts and rejoins the cluster without breaking quorum or causing visible downtime - First by simply trying to rejoin with their existing data set, otherwise trying to join as a new member with a clean state, or by replacing the entire instance if necessary.

d. Disaster recovery: In the event of a quorum loss, consequence of the simultaneous failure of a majority of the members, the operator coordinates to snapshot any live members and cleanly stop then, before seeding a new cluster from the latest data revision available once the expected amount of instances are ready to start again.
